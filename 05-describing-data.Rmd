# Describing and Visualizing Data{#CH5}
> In this chapter we'll work through a few examples of viewing, summarizing, and visualizing data. We'll avoid importing files to make it as easy as possible to follow along.

## Viewing Data {-}
First, we'll read in the **powerlifting.csv** file in the data folder. 

```{r}
data <- read.csv("power.csv")
```

After running the code above, you should see an object called  `data` under the `Environment` tab in the upper right pane of RStudio. If you click on the white grid icon, RStudio will display the data in tabular form. 

```{r echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE, out.height= '80%', out.width= '80%', fig.align='center'}
setwd("..")
knitr::include_graphics("./images/rstudio_view.png")
```

In this tabular view you can filter columns, arrange columns by ascending or descending values, and search values.  

```{r echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE, out.height= '80%', out.width= '80%', fig.align='center'}
setwd("..")
knitr::include_graphics("./images/rstudio_tabular.png")
```

Another way to get the feel for an entire dataset is with the `str()` function. The benefit of the `str()` function is that the variable type is also displayed.

```{r}
str(data)
```

If you're only interested in viewing the first few rows or last few rows of data you can use the `head()` and `tail()` functions, respectively: 

```{r}
head(data) # First 6 rows
tail(data) # Last 6 rows
```

Sometimes it's useful/convenient to access certain attributes of the data frame, such as the column names. A few of the functions for accessing attributes are provided below. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
dim(data)        # Dimensions
nrow(data)       # Number of rows
ncol(data)       # Number of columns
colnames(data)   # Column names
```

## Data Summaries {-}
One of the quickest and most useful ways to produce a data summary is with the `summary()` function. This function is versatile and works well with both continuous and categorical data: 

```{r}
summary(data)
```

For R to correctly interpret the categorical variables in this data frame, like `sex` and `self_ID`, the variables must be of the `factor` variable type. Currently these variables are listed as `character`. They can be converted to factors with the `as.factor()` function. We can then use the `summary()` function after converting the variable.

```{r}
summary(as.factor(data$sex))
summary(as.factor(data$`self_ID`))
```

You can also create a contingency table of the counts at each combination of factor levels with the `table()` function: 

```{r}
table(data$sex, data$self_ID)
```

More than two variables can be used, too. Similarly, you can create conditional proportions by passing the table created to the `prop.table()` function:

```{r}
prop.table(table(data$sex, data$self_ID))
```

Below are some more descriptive functions, and you can probably guess what each of them does. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
mean()
median()
var()
sd()
min()
max()
range()
quantile()
colSums()
rowSums()
colMeans()
rowMeans()
```

### Missing Data {-}
In the examples above, none of the data contained missing values, which made the data summaries easy to calculate. Missing data can be handled in many different ways, and selecting the most appropriate method is beyond the scope of this book. Instead, we'll only cover how to find and omit observations with missing data. First we'll create a data frame in R that contains `NA` values:

```{r}
data2 <- data.frame(Col1 = c(NA, 1, 21, 34, NA), 
                    Col2 = c(23, 34, 34, 12, 56),
                    Col3 = c(NA, 2, 12, 43, 12))
data2
```

You can use the `is.na()` function to assess if a value is missing in a data frame or not. For example: 

```{r}
is.na(data2)
# Missing values in data frame
```

What you get in return is `TRUE` and `FALSE` values. If the value is `TRUE`, that means there is an `NA` value in that location. This might not be particularly helpful, though, if you have a large data frame. Instead, it might be more useful to have the count of `NA` values returned. To do this, we could use the `is.na()` function wrapped inside of a `sum()` function: 

```{r}
sum(is.na(data2))
# Sum of missing values in data frame
```

You might want to know how many `NA` values are in a specific column rather than the entire dataset. Selecting just one column from a data frame is a very common task, and one way you can do this is with the dollar sign, `$`:

```{r}
sum(is.na(data2$Col1))
# Sum of missing values in Col1 
```

A quick way to get the missing values for all columns of a data frame is with the `colSums()` function:

```{r}
colSums(is.na(data2))
```

You can omit all missing values in a data frame with the `na.omit()` function:

```{r}
na.omit(data2)
```

The "opposite" of the `na.omit()` function would be finding and listing all the rows that *do* contain missing values, and that's what the code below accomplishes:

```{r}
data2[!complete.cases(data2), ]
```

Recall from [Chapter 2](#CH2) that brackets ,`[]`, are used to subset in R. For example, if you wanted the 5th row and 3rd column returned from a data frame, you could do this by subsetting the data frame like so: `data[5,3]`. The first item within the bracket refers to the row number, and the second number refers to the column number. If you don't put any numbers within the brackets, `data[,]`, then *everything* is selected (the entire data frame). Going back to the example above, you can see that `data2` is being subsetted by the rows. `complete.cases()` is a function similar to `na.omit()`, where the `NA` values are not included. Notice that there is an exclamation point, `!`, in front of the function. This means that instead of returning the cases that are complete, what's being returned is the cases that are *not* complete from the data frame. So, we're subsetting `data2` by its rows, where the *incomplete* cases are returned, and all the columns are selected. If that was confusing, that's okay!

>You might have noticed that you can select a column in R like this: `data$Col3`, and also like this `data[ ,3]`. There are almost always multiple ways to accomplish something in R, and both ways work equally well.

Let's try computing the mean for the first column of the `data2` object which contains missing values:

```{r}
mean(data2$Col1)
```

As you can see, `NA` is returned. This is because `Col1` contains missing values. Luckily the `mean()` function has an `na.rm` argument, which stands for 'not available, remove'. We can set this argument to `TRUE`, so that missing values will be removed when computing the mean: 

```{r}
mean(data2$Col1, na.rm = TRUE)
```

## Visualizing Data {-}
There are entire books written about visualizations in R. In fact, there are entire books written about visualizations in R *using one specific package*! Here, we just wanted to cover a few types of plots and plotting features that can hopefully be of use when analyzing data. 

### Histogram {-}
You can make histograms with the `hist()` function. All you need to do is select the column to plot, which in this case is `data$VJ_power_watts`, and the rest will be done for you: 

```{r}
hist(x = data$VJ_power_watts)
```

You could then change the color and labels, create a title, add vertical lines indicating the mean and median (which can each have their own color), change the bins, edit the axes, change the border color, and much more. This is just to give you an idea, in case you'd like to create more complete plots in R.  

```{r}
hist(x = data$VJ_power_watts, 
     col = "lightblue", 
     xlab = "Vertical Jump Power (Watts)",
     main = "Vertical Jump Power",
     border = "black")
abline(v = mean(data$VJ_power_watts), col = "red")
abline(v = median(data$VJ_power_watts), col = "black")
```

### Scatterplot {-}
You can use the `plot()` function to make scatter plots or various other types of plots. Simply pass your data frame object to the function and R will plot all of the relationships. 

```{r}  
plot(x = data)
```

Rather than using all of the data, you can select the relevant variables by subsetting:

```{r}
plot(data[4:6])
```

In the code above, the columns `4:6` were selected, which are the columns shown in the plot. You could then color the points by a categorical variable, such as the `self_ID` variable, which is a variable indicating whether a subject self-identifies as more of a power or endurance athlete. Remember that in order for this to work, the `self_ID` column needs to be converted to a factor. 

```{r}
plot(data[4:6], col = as.factor(data$self_ID))
```

If you wanted to plot the bivariate relationship between two of the variables, you would simply select two of the columns instead of three. Similar to the vertical lines in the histogram plot, you can add the slope and intercept to a plot with the same `abline()` function. These values were created by performing a linear model and then grabbing the coefficients from the model. 

```{r}  
plot(data[4:5])
intercept <- lm(VJ_power_watts ~ mass_kg, data = data)$coeff[1]
slope <- lm(VJ_power_watts ~ mass_kg, data = data)$coeff[2]
abline(coef = c(intercept, slope), col = "red",)
```

### Barplot {-}
You can make bar graphs by using the `table()` function used earlier in conjunction with the `barplot()` function. 

```{r}
barplot(table(data$self_ID))
barplot(table(data$self_ID, data$sex))
```

You can have the bars side-by-side instead of stacked by setting `beside = TRUE`. Notice that you can also generate legends for your plots with the `legend()` function and then coloring them accordingly. 

```{r}
barplot(table(data$sex, data$self_ID), 
        beside = TRUE, 
        col = c("lightcoral", "lightblue"))
legend("topleft", c("F", "M"), fill = c("lightcoral", "lightblue"))
```

### Boxplot {-}

Boxplots can be created with the `boxplots()` function. The formatting for this function may seem a little strange. For the `formula` argument, you'll first list the y variable followed the x variables. The x variables will be separted by a plus sign. This function automatically converts the `sex` and `self_ID` columns to factors for us.  

```{r}
boxplot(formula = VJ_power_watts ~ self_ID + sex, 
        data = data, 
        col = c("lightcoral", "lightgoldenrod", "lightblue", "lightgreen"))
```

>You can view the list of available color options for plots by typing `colors()` into the console.
