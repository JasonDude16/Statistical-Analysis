# Statistical-Analysis-Guidebook

The content in this guidebook was created by me and revised by my graduate program mentor, Dr. Keith Lohse (https://github.com/keithlohse). This repository is currently a work in progress.

The purpose of this guidebook is to provide a brief introduction to performing statistical analysis in R. It is assumed that the reader is knowledgeable about statistical analysis and is selecting the appropriate statistical model for whatever research question they would like to answer, but they are unsure of how to perform the analysis in R. Consequently, statistical theory will not be covered in this book. It is also assumed that the reader is unfamiliar with programming languages and concepts. Before delving into the various statistical models, a concise overview of programming concepts will be covered, so that hopefully the reader will feel comfortable with modifying and extending on example code to suit their analytic endeavors.

Chapters 1 and 2 will cover downloading and describing R and the RStudio IDE, and programming basics, such as variable types and data types, objects and assignments, and functions and arguments. Chapters 3 and 4 will cover installing/loading packages and reading/writing data. Chapters 5 and 6 will cover descriptive statistics, visualizing data, and formatting data. Chapters 7-13 will cover various statistical models from the General Linear Model framework.
